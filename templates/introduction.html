            He now has over a decade's worth of experience working with python and has spent the last four years using it professionally as a self-proclaimed
            software engineer across multiple freelance platforms.  The extent of his work for clients has ranged from web and workflow automations to the
            development of custom desktop and web applications.

          <h4>About</h4>

          <p class="about-p">This project bundled: <br>
            <ul>
              <li>an API connection to Interactive Brokers for sending and querying orders as well as fetching market data.</li>
              <li>a trade strategy class, allowing for writing and easily configuring custom trade strategies.</li>
              <li>charting functionality for displaying both historical and live data as well as trade indicator overlays.</li>
              <li>functionality for trading in simulation versus live trading.</li>
              <li>and a graphical user interface to tie everything together, complete with a separate configuration page.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <br>

            As an add on, the same underlying app skeleton was also later used to create a backtester application.
              The trade backtester allowed a user to run a specified
            trade strategy over historical data to see how the strategy would have performed during that time period.  Backtesters are typically employed
            in order to decide whether or not to run a new trading strategy.

            <br>
            <br>

            The backtester app has functionality for plotting the historical data over the specified time period and configured data resolution, and
            also includes peripheral functionality like plotting trade take-profits and stops on the chart, plotting trade indicator objects,
            and has helper functions that allow for the user to step through market data updates or skip to notable events like
            trade setups, order sends, order fills, order cancels, trade exits, etc.  It also has a summary printout providing statistics like percentage of
            winning / losing trades, etc, etc.

                      underlying trade strategy considers.  Additionally, peripheral functionality exists to change the charting & data resolution (1 min bars, 5min, 10 min, etc) and

          <h4>About</h4>

          <p class="about-p">I've created hundreds of TradingView indicators, strategies, and libraries using TV's native scripting language, <code>pinescript</code>.
          Here's an example of a strategy that I previously employed paired with trading software that I wrote.  The software takes signals emitted by the charting platform (TV),
          translates those signals into actionable trades, and then forwards those trades to a configured broker for execution.  Trades are then monitored for
          updates such as fills, exits, and changes in the profit & loss total and the GUI is updated appropriately.

                  <p>Here's an overlay of a TradingView strategy I use for buying equities off of previous or current session lows (simplified).
                    I created it with TradingView's scripting language, <code>Pinescript</code>.
                    A cool feature of the TradingView software is that it employs callbacks or webhooks for whenever
                    a trade occurs per the coded strategy.  This allows you to easily forward data and talk to other applications in the event
                    that a trade occurs.</p>

                    I set the TradingView webhooks to the API call of that website that adds trade signals to a database within this flask app.
                    I set the payload from TradingView's side to include attributes like trade direction, quantity, price,
                    and an API key used for authentication purposes (so that trades can't be spoofed by others).
                    Whenever new signals are posted and unprocessed, they are displayed on this dashboard page simply as a timestamp of when they occurred.</p>

                  <h5>Desktop App</h5>
                  <p>This app handles all authentication on the broker side, as well as functionality that continues to refresh authentication as tokens near expiration.  This ensures that
                    the session does not go stale or that the user is not logged out during a trade session.
                    The app then subscribes to market streams for any equities set to trade in the app's configuration.  I use a python requests stream / session object
                    to handle market update messages and keep a current orderbook for anything I am trading.
                    A separate thread is started and a timeout occurs every (configured) few seconds.  On a timeout,
                    the application will poll the flask app to see if any new trade signals have arrived since the last poll.
                    If a new signal has occurred, the app translates, formats, and sends a new order to my broker's API.
                    An audit trail is provided both in the 'Processed Signals' and the 'Trade Review' windows.
                    My trading exposure is then updated in the 'Open Positions' window.

          </div>

          <h4>About</h4>

          <p class="about-p">
            This is software commissioned by a roofing company that wanted improvements in efficiency to their backoffice invoicing department.
            It bundles multiple pieces of integrated and standalone software that both automate and improve the entire process.

            <br>
            <br>

            <strong>Some background:</strong>  When a roof is replaced through insurance, insurance will initially send out a payment that is only a fraction of the
            amount that insurance is covering for the full roof replacement.  Once the roofing company has completed the elected work for the homeowner,
            they will send proof of completion off to the insurance company and ask that the remainder of the claim be paid out to the homeowner, making the homeowner
            full on the claim.

            <br>
            <br>

            <strong>Where this task can become tedious:</strong>  The roofing company may not complete all line items found within the insurance paperwork.  The roofing company may forego
            entire trades or it might be the case that an individual line item, like chimney flashing, for example, was not completed.  So for each of the thousands of roofs that are worked on each year, the company needs to ensure that
            all invoicing on both the homeowner and insurance side matches the actual line items completed.

            <br>
            <br>

            <strong>The existing workflow:</strong> The invoicing department receives a PDF copy of the insurance paperwork which itemizes all work that the insurance company is willing
            to cover for their policyholder, aka the homeowner.
            The employee in the invoicing department of the roofing company then uses notes and orders within the company's business management system
            to determine which of the insurance line items were completed throughout the course of the roofing job.
            <br>
            Where this process typically is less straightforward than it sounds:
            The differing trades (roof, gutters, siding) are all completed at different times, homeowners may change their minds on the product and what work to have completed during the roofing process, there
            may be portions of work that were not originally noticed by the insurance company and supplemental work is later added to the claim, etc.

            Because the paperwork exists in PDF, the employee then manually tallies each of the completed line items to each of the trade groups completed.
            An example of this might be:

            <br>
            <br>

            Again, it is typical that not every line item within the insurance paperwork gets billed for.  The cherrypicking
            of doing this line item here, but not this one here, etc, etc creates additional work in that
            the numbers must be reconciled to ensure no items were skipped.  This results in the employee spending much more time
            than necessary for what should be a relatively easy and straightforward task.

            <br>
            <br>

            <strong>The new workflow:</strong>  The software that I created is an interface that exposes the user to all of the following:

            <br>
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>Parsing insurance paperwork pdfs to csv / table format</li>

                <li>An auto-reconciliation total to assert all items have been correctly parsed and accounted for</li>

                  <h5>Multiline Formats</h5>
                  <p>Additionally, insurance paperwork from the same insurer might have differing formats.  The most variation in
                     parsing comes from inline vs. multiline line items.  Inline is what it sounds like; all line item datapoints fall on
                     the same line horizontally.  Whereas multiline items might include several lines (vertically) for a single line item.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     Both algorithms search for a regular expression to find the item description (i.e. 12. R&R Chimney Flashing).  The inline
                     algorithm then looks for all elements that occur to the right of the item description.  The multiline algorithm will draw
                     a bounding box which is separately configured for each of the insurance companies to find any overlapping elements that
                     occur within that bounding box.  If it is multiline paperwork, the user simply checks the Multiline Items? checkbox.

          <h4>About</h4>

          <p class="about-p">This was software commissioned for a roofing company in Illinois to better track their internal compensation structure for members of its sales team.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Background:</strong> As a sales contractor progresses through a program of internally tracked milestones--like the number of completed roofing jobs or the size of their sales team for example--the
            contractor will graduate to higher payout tiers that entail a better, albeit more complicated, compensation structure.

          <h4>About</h4>

          <p class="about-p">This was a commissioned app that listens to a user-provided Twitter (Now X) handle
            that provides NBA player updates.  The app in theory aims to take advantage of the discrepancy between new, live
            info about a player's status crossing and the time it takes for that information to be reflected in game/betting lines.  If
            a discrepency exists, the app automatically places a bet looking to take advantage of this discrepancy.</p>

          <div class="container text-center video-container justify-content-around rounded">

            <video controls>
              <source src="{{url_for('static', filename='videos/new_sports_b_demo.mp4')}}" type="video/mp4">
              Sorry, your browser does not support videos.
            </video>

          </div>

          <p><strong>Details:</strong> The user would configure which Twitter handle they wanted
          to listen to for player updates and then connect to the Twitter API.  Then the user would set
          an additional two tables in the app configuration.  One was a 'trigger' table.  It is a series
          of player names and a respective list of actionable verbs or statuses (these could be set to use
          a configured set of default verbs).  The second table
          was a 'bet' table in which the user would configure either 'team' or 'player' bets and then link those bets to triggers
          in the 'trigger' table (player + verb).  If a new tweet crossed containing both the player name and any of the
          configured verbage, the bets linked to that specific trigger would be placed on the bookmaker's site.  This was an
          entirely automated workflow, aka the end-user would just setup configuration variables, start it, and let it run.
          </p>

            <h3>What I Used:</h3>
            <ul>

              <li><code>PyQt</code> for the user interface</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
            <p>I thought that there would be 0% chance that discrepencies existed, or basically that the tweeted info would have already
              been reflected in the lines by the time the app received the update.  Through basic testing it actually looked like these opportunities existed for
              a substantial amount of time, something like upwards of 30 seconds. A.k.a. plenty of time to take advantage of programatically...

          sale at any given point in time.  My client wanted a tool that would easily differentiate any new listings from existing
          listings, & the client also wanted the added ability to be notified of listings in realtime and the ability to further filter
          any new license listings to specified criteria (e.g. meeting a specific price range for a particular section).</p>

                    the configured URL mappings, the browser will visit each of those websites.  The app will then find current license listings
                    and compare those to the ones already existing in the database for that specific team.  If new license listings are found and
                    they meet any further specified or configured criteria, the end user receives a message through Telegram.

              <ul>
                <li><code>pythonanywhere.com</code> for hosting the code & database and for task scheduling</li>
                <li><code>selenium</code> for running a browser and interacting with web elements</li>
                <li><code>telegram-python</code> the python telegram client for creating and running a bot server</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
              <p>Although a simple app, I had most difficulty with the loading of marketplace webpages.  For some reason they are just really
              slow web pages (maybe because they are .aspx).  This resulted in additional code that would either have to assert a successful marketplace load,
              or in the event of an unsuccessful load, that all of the existing database entries for that specific team's tickets were not deleted
              from the database --> basically a page would not load, the app would read this as that team not having any tickets for sale (no listing elements found),
              and then the app would delete all existing database entries because it assumed that all of those listings were delisted.  On the next update and successful page load,
              the app would then send like 500 messages for each listing thinking that all of these listings were new (empty database table).
              </p>
              <p>I also had to determine the most efficient task schedule in order to not exceed the amount of cloud resources
              aka compute time that the client was willing to pay for.  This tool was also a good refresher on Telegram bot messaging and error catching / waits
              in selenium.

          <h4>About</h4>

          <p>I've created hundreds of TradingView indicators, strategies, and libraries using their native language, <code>pinescript</code>.
          Here's an example of a strategy that I currently employ paired with software I wrote to provide a callback for trade
          signals emitted by the TradingView platform.  The callback adds the received trade signals to a database housed within a flask
          application hosted on pythonanywhere.com.  A separate piece of software then polls an API exposed by the flask application, and
          will then send translated, and actionable orders to my broker for execution.</p>

                  <p>Here's an overlay of a TradingView strategy I use for buying equities off of lows. I created it with TradingView's scripting language, Pinescript.  A cool feature of the TradingView software is that it employs callbacks or webhooks for whenever a trade would occur per the coded strategy.</p>

                  <h5>API and Dashboard</h5>
                  <p>Here's a barebones API + dashboard I created with flask and host for free on pythonanywhere.com.  I set the TradingView webhooks to the API call that adds trade signals to a database within the flask API.  I set the payload from TradingView's side to include attributes like trade side, quantity, price, and an API key used for authentication.  Whenever new signals are posted, they are displayed on this dash page.</p>

                  <p>This app handles all authentication on the broker side.  It then subscribes to market price streams for any equities I have allowed to trade in the app's configuration.  I use a python requests stream to handle market update messages and keep a current orderbook for anything I am trading.  A separate thread is started and a timeout occurs every n seconds.  On a timeout, the application polls my flask API / dashboard to see if any new trade signals have arrived since the last poll.
                    If a new signal has occurred, a few safety checks are run, and if passed, the app translates and formats a new order to my broker's API.  An audit trail is provided both in the 'Processed Signals' and the 'Trade Review' windows.  My positions are then also updated in the 'Open Positions' window.

          <h4>About</h4>

          <p>Predictit.org, a political prediction market geared towards studying the phenomenom of 'wisdom of crowds',
            used to have markets related to how many times the president would tweet in a week.  The market was split up
            where you could purchase shares in buckets, say 240-250 (yes, total tweets in a week--Donald Trump used to tweet like
            a mad man).  The bet would be in the money if the total tweets from that account settled within the bucket by the end of the week.

                  <h5>PredictIt Overview</h5>
                  <p>PredictIt offers various markets where you can purchase shares in topics such as the next president
                     of the United States, which country will go to war next, and which world leader or Supreme Court Justice
                     will pass away next (it is a sad corner of the web).

                  <h5>Markets</h5>
                  <p>On settlement, the correct option in the market will settle to $1.  So in practice, if I were to purchase shares of
                      Biden for $0.43 per share and he is re-elected President of the United States, I would make $0.57 per share I purchased.
                      I am also afforded the opportunity to effectively short that option by purchasing 'No' shares which should be priced inversely
                      to those shares in the 'Yes' market.

                  <h5>Models</h5>
                  <p>First, using the Twitter API and existing databases for both Donald Trump's and the Whitehouses tweets,
                    I collected basic summary stats on the historical behavior of both of these accounts. Then using that info + some basic stats and very fundamental options pricing
                    models, I was able to create a dashboard that would help try to predict the likelihood that certain options would hit.
                  </p>
                  <p>This is just a simple illustration of pace.  At this point in time (early in the week), the President would have tweeted 9 times
                    more than on average at this point in the week.  And then a simple extrapolation from that, would be on pace to settle at about
                    253 total tweets for the week.

                  <h5>Pricing</h5>
                  <p>Using the various models, projections, etc, all of that info was used to come up with a theoretical price for all of
                    the current options.  Opportunities existed if the actual market was trading at something like $0.20 for the 250-259 market
                    (your belief would be that this market was underpriced, so you'd buy shares), and the 260-269 market was trading at something like
                    $0.30 (your belief being that it is currently overpriced, so you'd sell shares).

                    The model proved to be pretty effective (at least in the sense that it gave me slightly more conviction in some of trades I was
                    taking on).  This resulted in me being ranked in the top 100 of PredictIt users in terms of profitability on an almost weekly basis.

                    I believe at one point they brought it back for President Biden, but it proved to be a dead market without the same wacky tweet habits
                    as that of President Trump.  Sad.
